AdiCCMonitor helps you keeping track of group crowd-control spells.

It detects your own crowd-control spells and those of your party/raids and can provide feedbacks in two ways :
- icons: a bar of icons showing running spells, their target symbols and the remaining time.
- alerts: messages that can be sent to any channel (using LibSink-2.0) for certain events: spell applied/ended/broken, cast failures and about-to-end warning. Note: *alerts are only sent while in instance*.

AdiCCMonitor already comes with a bunch of options. Use /adiccmonitor, /acm or Interface options to open AdiCCMonitor configuration panel.
